                    Adaptability, cohesiveness and Responsiveness
                </h2>
                <p>A responsive website includes all the same content and information on any device you access it on, but it changes the way it’s displayed and arranged based on the size of the device screen. This is the best option for making the website mobile friendly, because you’re not limiting the information your mobile visitors can access – they still get all the same content the rest of your visitors do. Responsive in web design is comprehensive use of HTML, Javascript and CSS to automatically resize, hide, shrink, enlarge, a website, to make it adapt and look great on all devices (desktops, tablets, and phones). Furthermore, Adaptive and Responsive Web design is the approach that suggests that design and development should respond to the user's behavior and environment considering screen size, platform and orientation. The practice includes a mix of flexible grids and layouts, images and an intelligent use of CSS media queries. The website designed, developed and submitted as part of this look and feel assignment thoroughly complies the quality of responsiveness.</p>

                    Features and points to be considered while designing a mobile web:

                    <ol>
                        <br>
                        <li>Make Information People Look for Easier to Find</li>
                        <li>Mobile responsiveness</li>
                        <li>Don’t use Flash.</li>
                        <li>Include the viewport media tag.meta name=”viewport” content=”width =device-width, initial-scale=1″</li>
                        <li>Turn autocorrect for forms.</li>
                        <li>Make sure the button sizes are large enough to adapt to mobile environment.</li>
                        <li>Good information architecture</li>
                        <li>Compress CSS and images.</li>

                    Usability and reliability throughout the application is achieved through below:
                    <ol>
                        <br>

                        <li>No snapped links to make sure that website navigates as intended.</li>
                        <li>Mobile responsiveness is achieved using appropriate meta tags, CSS and resizable components.</li>
                        <li>Server uptime is achieved by hosting our web site on USF cloud server.</li>
                        <li>Simplicity and Familiarity is achieved by using quite a simple layouts which are easy to incorporate and reuse.</li>
                        <li>Consistency is achieved by maintaining look and feel across the website though a component based and a modular approach.</li>
                        <li>Guidance is achieved by providing relevant links and other associated navigable components.</li>

                        <li>Good information architecture is achieved through adapting hierarchical information flow model.</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>


                <h2>
                    Design Principles
                </h2>
                <h4 align="left">Effective color scheme</h4>
                <p>Color schemes are more important than customers realize. Different colors have the ability to evoke emotional responses, such as calm, happiness, or frustration. When it comes to using colors in your website design, it's essential to consider your company's niche, target audience, branding, and the elements of color theory. We have used effective color palette to comply prior stated design principle</p>
                <h4 align="left">Relevancy and associativity</h4>
                <p>We have made sure that the content hosted on the website is highly relevant and apt for the students and certificate aspirants which provide highly credible information.</p>
                <h4 align="left">Short loading time</h4>
                <p>When looking for information online, nothing aggravates visitors more than slow loading times. Customers can be turned away completely due to this issue. Testing your website ahead of time will help you pinpoint any loading time issues, and these can be fixed before your site's official release. To increase customer retention and provide a positive user experience, periodically evaluate your website's loading time once it has launched. Short load times give customers the information they want when they want it. If your site can't deliver, a competitor's site will. We have achieved short times by comprehensively testing against multiple use cases.</p>
                <h4 align="left">Divine proportions</h4>
                <p>We have used the divine proportions model to make sure that menus, forms and other associated form components are complying to achieve consistency as whole.</p>
                <h4 align="left">Simplicity</h4>
                <p>Many sites are bloated and over-designed, with too many elements on the page, distracting visitors from the purpose of the site. In effective web design, simplicity is prime aspect. Not only does a crisp clean, fresh design make the site easier to navigate, but the aesthetically appealing elements and will stand the test of time. It is unnecessary, as well as quite distracting, to load a site with design features that don't serve a significant purpose. Our design is simple so the users can find their way intuitively, naturally and easily.     </p>
                <h4 align="left">Aesthetically appealing</h4>
                <p>Our target audience are students and certificate aspirants. Our design is exquisitely craft explicitly to appeal to that niche.</p>
                <h4 align="left">Usability and Functionality</h4>
                <p>In website design, usability and functionality must drive each decision complimenting other design consideration. To achieve a clear, easy, and ultimately, direct path to conversions, both design and technical issues come into action. Every link must function fast, and every button and call to action must be positioned aptly, demanding as little effort as possible for the visitor to move forward to the next step. We have made sure that our website is highly usable and functional.</p>
                <h4 align="left">Easily Understood</h4>
                <p>Site visitors must be able to easily able to comprehend every word, phrase, and headline without any perplexing thoughts. One unusual or less commonly used word or phrase will drive them off. Industry-specific terms that are not in common usage will hinder your appeal. Dense, complex content won't work. Calls to action that are unclear or hard to find will be skipped and you have one more lost customer. All site content and each visual element must be laid out clearly and cleanly, with all critical conversion points visible above the fold (not requiring scrolling to find). Any deviation merely creates a barrier to conversion. So, we have made sure that our web-site design is easily understood.</p>
                <h4 align="left">Design elements inspire users to go deep</h4>
                <p>Your homepage must have an initial appeal in design and usability. Every design feature is then developed with the specific purpose to inspire the visitor to find out more - and go deeper into your site, and in the end, convert and become a customer. It takes rare skills to achieve this purpose, as well as experience and insight into user behaviors. Nothing should be left to chance your design should naturally lead them to where you want them to go.</p>
