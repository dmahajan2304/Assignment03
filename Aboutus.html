                            DataExpert was founded in 2015 by three Computer Science professors who wanted to share their knowledge and skills with the world. Expert1 and Expert2 put their courses online for anyone to take - and taught
                            more learners in a few months than they could have in an entire lifetime in the classroom.
                            Since then, we’ve built a platform where anyone, anywhere can learn and earn credentials from the world’s top education providers.
